# Competitive-Programming-Environment
competitive programming environment for Linux users it allow them to compile, run and compare there results with the correct result in just one command

## How to run

#### Linux

1. Copy the input example from the programming exercise and paste it in the input file.
2. Copy the output example from the programming exercise and paste it in the output file.
3. Start typing your code in your preferred language in it's main file
- main.c for c
- main.cpp for c++
- main.java for java
- main.py for python
4. Open terminal
5. Go to project directory
```bash
cd <path>
```
6. Run the following command
- for c
```bash
./c
```
- for c++
```bash
./cpp
```
- for java
```bash
./java
```
- for python
```bash
./py
```

- **The program will complie first if there is an error it will print it else if your output equals the examples output it will print"Accepted" else it will print "Wrong answer" and the different between them**
- **Make sure to install java before using it, [How to install java on Linux](http://tipsonubuntu.com/2016/07/31/install-oracle-java-8-9-ubuntu-16-04-linux-mint-18/)**
- **Python 3 is used**

## Example

#### The example used is a simple example where the input is 2 integers and the output is their same
- The programs written in c/c++ and python prints the correct answer so the output on the screen should be **"Accepted"**.
- Will java program just prints the first number (not their sum) so the output on the screen should be **"Wrong answer"**.
